            The Cragmaws keep a kennel of foul-tempered wolves that they are training for battle.
            Just inside the cave mouth, a few uneven stone steps lead up to a small, dank chamber on the east side of the passage. The cave narrows to a steep fissure at the far end, and is filled with the stench of animals. Savage snarls and the sounds of rattling chains greet your ears where two wolves are chained up just inside the opening. Each wolf's chain leads to an iron rod driven into the base of a stalagmite.
            Three wolves are confined here. They can't reach targets standing on the steps, but all three attack any creature except a goblin that moves into the room (see the "Developments" section). 
            
            Goblins in nearby caves ignore the sounds of fighting wolves, since they constantly snap and snarl at each other.
            
            A character who tries-to calm the animals can attempt a DC 15 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. 
            On a success, the wolves allow the character to move throughout the room. If the wolves are given food, the DC drops to 10.
            
            Fissure. A narrow opening in the east wall leads to a natural chimney that climbs 30 feet to area 8. 
            At the base of the fissure is rubbish that's been discarded through the opening above. 
            A character attempting to ascend or descend the chimney shaft must make a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check. 
            If the check succeeds, the character moves at half speed up or down the shaft, as desired. 
            On a check result of 6-9, the character neither gains nor loses ground; 
            on a result of 5 or less, the character falls and takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10 feet fallen, landing prone at the base of the shaft.

            DEVELOPMENTS
            If the wolves are goaded by enemies beyond their reach, they are driven into a frenzy that allows them to yank the iron rod securing their chains out of the floor. Each round that any character remains in sight, the wolves attempt a single DC 15 Strength check. 
            On the first success, they loosen the rod and the DC drops to 10. On a second success, they yank the rod loose, bending it so that their chains are freed.
            A goblin or bugbear can use its action to release one wolf from its chain.

            The goblin notices the characters if they carry any light or don't use stealth as they approach the bridge. 
            The goblin does not attack. Instead, it attempts to sneak away to the east to inform its companions in area 7 to release a flood.

A narrow waterfall high in the eastern wall feeds the pool, which drains out the western end of the chamber to form the stream that flows out of the cave mouth below.

            Six goblins inhabit this den, and one of them is a leader with 12 hit points. The five ordinary goblins tend the cooking fire in the lower (northern) part of the cave near the entrance passage, while the leader rests in the upper (southern) part of the cave.

            they complete their part of the bargain.
            If the characters refuse to parley, Yeemik shoves Sildar over the edge and continues with the fight. Sildar takes
            Id6 bludgeoning damage from the fall, which is enough to drop him to 0 hit points. Quick-acting characters can try to stabilize him before he dies (see "Damage, Healing, and Dying" in the rulebook).
            
            ROLE PLAYING SILDAR
            Sildar Kinter is a kindhearted human male of nearly fifty years who holds a place of honor in the famous
            griffon cavalry of the great city of Water deep. He is an agent of the Lords' Alliance, a group of allied political powers concerned with mutual security and prosperity. Members of the order ensure the safety of cities and other settlements by proactively eliminating threats by any means, while bringing honor and glory to their leaders
            and homelafds.
            Sildar me\ Gundren Rockseeker in Neverwinter and agreed to accpmpany him back to Phandalin. Sildar wants to investigate the fate of larno Albrek, a human wizard and fellow membe~of the Lords' Alliance who disappeared shortly after arriving in Phandalin. Sildar hopes to learn what happened to larno, assist Gundren in reopening the old mine, and help restore Phandalin to a civilized center of wealth and prosperity.
            
            Sildar provides the characters with four pieces of useful information:
            To The three Rockseeker brothers (Gundren, Tharden, and Nundro) recently located an entrance to the long-lost Wave Echo Cave, site of the mines of the Phandelver's Pact. (Share the information in the first two paragraphs of the "Background" section to the players at this time.) Klarg, the bugbear who leads this goblin band, had orders to waylay Gundren. Sildar heard from the goblins that the Black Spider sent word that the dwarf was to
            be brought to him. Sildar doesn't know who or what the
            Black Spider is.
            o Gundren had a map showing the secret location of Wave
            Echo Cave, but the goblins took it when they captured him. Sildar believes that Klarg sent the map and the dwarf to the chief of the Cragmaws at a place called Cragmaw Castle. Sildar doesn't know where that might be, but he suggests someone in Phandalin might know. (It doesn't occur to Sildar immediately, but a captured goblin might also be persuaded to divulge the castle's location. See the "What the Goblins Know" sidebar on page 8.)
            Sildar's contact in Phandalin is a human wizard named Iarno Albrek. The wizard traveled to the town two months ago to establish order there. After the Lords' Alliance received no word from Iarno, Sildar decided to investigate.
            Sildar tells the characters that he intends to continue on to Phandalin, since it's the nearest settlement. He offers to pay the party 50 gp to provide escort. Although he has no money on him, Sildar can secure a loan to pay the characters within a day after arriving in Phandalin. First, he hopes they'll put a stop to the goblin raids by clearing out the caves.
            
            DEVELOPMENTS
            If he is rescued and healed, Sildar Hallwinter remains with the party but is anxious to reach Phandalin as quickly as possible. He doesn't have any weapons or armor, but
            he can take a shortsword from a defeated goblin or use a weapon loaned to him by a character.
            If Sildar joins the party, see the "NPC Party Members" sidebar for tips on how to run him.

            TREASURE
            Yeemik carries a pouch containing three gold teeth (1 gp each) and 15 sp. Sildar's gear, along with Gundren Rockseeker, was taken to Cragmaw Castle.
            
            NPC PARTY MEMBERS
            An NPC might join the party, if only for a short time. Here are some tips to help you run an NPC party member:
            + Let the characters make the important decisions. They are the protagonists of the adventure. If the characters ask an N PC party member for advice or direction, remember that NPCs make mistakes too.
            + An NPC won't deliberately put himself or herself in harm's
            way unless there's a good reason to do so.
            An NPC won't treat all party members the same way, which can create some fun friction. As an N PC gets to know the characters, think about which characters the NPC likes most and which ones the NPC likes least, and let those likes and dislikes affect how the NPC interacts with the party members. In a combat encounter, keep the NPC's actions simple and straightforward. Also, look for things that the N PC can do besides fighting. For example, an NPC might stabilize a dying character, guard a prisoner, or help barricade a door.
            + If an NPC contributes greatly to the party's success in a
            battle, the NPC should receive an equal share ofthe XP
            earned for the encounter. (The characters receive less XP as a consequence.)
            + NPCs have their own lives and goals. Consequently, an NPC should remain with the party only as long as doing so makes sense for those goals.

A larger opening leads north down a set of natural stone steps, the roar of falling water echoing from beyond. In the middle of the cavern, the coals ofa large fire smolder.
            Klarg the bugbear shares this cave with his mangy pet wolf, Ripper, and two goblins. The bugbear is filled with delusions of grandeur and views himself as a mighty warlord just beginning his career of conquest. He is not entirely sane, referring to himself in the third person ("Who dares defy Klarg?" or "Klarg will build a throne
            from your bones, puny
            ones!"). The goblins under his command resent his bullying.
            Fire Pit. The hot coals in the central fire pit deal 1 fire damage to any creature that enters the fire pit, or 1d6 fire damage to any creature that falls prone there. A creature can take each type of damage only once per round.
            Natural Chimney. A niche
            in the western wall forms the top of a shaft that descends 30 feet to area 3. See that area for information on climbing the natural chimney.
            Supplies. The piles of sacks and crates can provide half cover to any creature fighting or hiding behind them. Most are marked with the image of a blue lion--the symbol of the Lionshield Coster, a merchant company with a warehouse
            and trading post in Phandalin. Hidden among the supplies is an unlocked treasure chest
            belonging to Klarg (see the "Treasure" section). Any character who searches the supplies finds the chest.
            DEVELOPMENTS
            If Klarg is warned by the goblins in area 7 that the hideout is under attack, he and his wolf hide behind stalagmites while the goblins take cover behind the piles of supplies, hoping to ambush the characters when they enter the cave.
            If Klarg and company are not warned about possible attackers, the characters have a good chance to surprise them. The easiest way for the characters to achieve this
            is to climb the chimney from area 3, since Klarg does not expect an attack from that direction.
            If the wolf is killed, the bugbear attempts to climb down the chimney to area 3 and flee the cave complex.
            TREASURE
            The captured stores are bulky, and the characters will need a wagon to transport them. If they return the supplies to the Lionshield Coster in Phandalin (see part 2, "Phandalin''), they earn a reward of 50 gp and the friendship of Linene and her company.
            In addition to the stolen provisions, Klarg has a treasure chest that contains 600 cp, 110 sp, two potions of healing, and ajade statuette of a frog with tiny golden orbs for eyes (40 gp). The frog statuette is small enough to fit in a pocket or pouch.
